# SPL–UTSPAN 2026 – Yukuan's Solution

## Submission Abstract

This repository contains the complete code for my SPL–UTSPAN 2026 submission, including the final Kaggle notebook and supporting utilities. Each shot is modeled as a fixed-length 3D keypoint sequence (240 frames). The pipeline is: geometric normalization (root centering and robust scale stabilization), adaptive release-frame estimation (`t0`) via a motion-peak heuristic, and feature extraction that combines (i) raw flattened trajectories, (ii) multiscale temporal block summaries (mean/std at several window sizes), and (iii) local `t0`-window statistics. 

I train one model per target (`angle`, `depth`, `left_right`) using Ridge regression with standardization and cross-validation. The final submission file is generated by matching the official template format (scaled or unscaled columns). Experimental ablations (GroupKFold evaluation, two-stage residual Ridge, and XGBoost baselines) are included for reference.
